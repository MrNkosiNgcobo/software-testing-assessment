Q2 - In order to delight the user with these features, how would you want it to work?
01. Conduct user research: Understand who your users are, their goals, needs, and pain points. Conduct surveys, interviews,
                           or usability testing to gain insights into their behaviors and preferences.
02. Develop user personas: Create user personas to represent different types of users and their characteristics. This will
                           help you design features that cater to their specific needs.
03. Identify user stories: Develop user stories that outline the different scenarios in which your product will be used.
                           This will help you prioritize features that are most important to your users.
04. Prototype and test: Create prototypes of your product features and test them with users. This will help you identify
                        areas that need improvement and make necessary changes.
05. Iterate: Use the feedback you receive from user testing to iterate and improve your features. Continuously test and
             iterate until you are confident that your features are meeting the needs of your users.


There are several aspects of this feature that can be automated in testing. Here are some examples:
01. User Creation: Automation can be done to create test scenarios and data for creating new users based on the
                   available licenses. This can include testing whether the correct license is assigned to the user
                   based on the available licenses.
02. User Details: Automation can be done to test the ability to edit user details such as name, email, and other
                  relevant information. This can include testing whether changes made to the user details are
                  reflected in the system correctly.
03. User Deletion: Automation can be done to test the ability to remove users. This can include testing whether the
                   correct user is removed from the system and whether any associated data is also deleted as expected.
04. Role-based Access: Automation can be done to ensure that only client administrators have access to this feature.
                       This can include testing whether the feature is hidden from other user roles and whether access
                       is granted to the correct role.
05. Integration Testing: Automation can be done to test the integration of this feature with other parts of the system.
                         For example, testing whether the user data is correctly synchronized with other modules of the
                         system.
06. Security Testing: Automation can be done to test the security aspects of this feature, such as checking whether user
                      data is protected from unauthorized access, whether input validation is working as expected, and
                      whether any security vulnerabilities are present in the system.

Overall, automation can help ensure that this feature is thoroughly tested and works as expected. It can also help save
time and reduce the risk of errors during testing.
